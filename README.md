# Name The Artist

The goal is to create a single-page website application that allows the user to play a simple game of Wheel of Fortune / Hangman. The specific game I created is called 'Name the Artist' and requires the user to determine what artist matches the description and/or artwork shown.

## How to Play

On load, a random artist is selected and a textual description of his/her work appears. If the user finds it too difficult to guess based on the description there is a 'Show Artwork' button that displays a work of art by the artist as an additional hint. The sidebar functionality is integral to how the game is played. Underneath the 'Next Word' button, a letter that is typed on the user's keyboard will always be displayed. After a letter is chosen and 'ENTER' is pressed, that user submits the letter as a guess for the word's characters. Underneath that there is also an option for the user to submit a guess for the exact artist/word (not characters). Minor statistics are displayed such as the number of successful wins the user accomplished and the number of incorrect guesses remaining until a loss. On win or loss, a modal appears in the center of the main content area as a response to the user.
